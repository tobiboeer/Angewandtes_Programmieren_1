# Welcome to our Tutorial!<br/>

**Tip:** You can keep this window open, while using the program. 
But it is recommended to use it fullscreen to avoid graphic errors!<br/> 
<br/>
# Map<br/>
You can use the mouse to hover over the map. The districts and stations will
be highlighted and shown in the bottom left corner.<br/>

<br/>
## Zoom and Navigation<br/>
You can zoom in and out by using the mousewheel. Because this does not work as precisely as wanted,
you can use the scrollbars to navigate to specific districts and stations. <br/>

# Interactive Menu<br/>
The interactive menu helps the user to get information of train stations more easily. The three buttons
on top can be used to load different train networks. In the example below, you see the result of clicking
'Regional'. <br/>

## Choosing Stations<br/>
Stations from the train network can be chosen manually in the dropdown menu down below.
The search is easier if you type the searched station in. In this case we will choose 'Hamburg Hbf'. <br/>

<br/>
You can also choose a date and a time. This will limit your search results. To this week day, time and time span
around the time, by putting an hour number in the field 'Zeitfenster'. <br/>
